SQA-Automation-Testing-Test-Case
Welcome to the SQA Automation Testing Test Case repository!

In Software Quality Assurance (SQA), automation testing is a crucial method used to validate the functionality of software applications efficiently. Automated test cases are predefined sets of instructions designed to test software applications by simulating user interactions and verifying outcomes. This repository contains various automated test cases that ensure consistency, accuracy, and quality during the testing process.

Automated test cases are especially useful in regression testing, where they help ensure that new changes in the application do not negatively impact existing functionality.

📌 About This Repository
This repository contains a collection of automated test cases designed to test different software functionalities and features. It includes clear examples, instructions, and templates to help developers and testers create and execute automated tests effectively.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how to write automated test cases that are easy to understand, reusable, and efficient in identifying defects in software applications.

🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites
Before running the automated test cases, make sure you have the following tools installed:

Selenium or any other automation testing framework (like Cypress, Playwright, etc.)

Programming language environment (e.g., Java, Python, JavaScript)

Test framework (e.g., TestNG, JUnit, PyTest, Mocha)

Running the Test Cases
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/SQA-Automation-Testing-Test-Case.git
cd SQA-Automation-Testing-Test-Case
Install the required dependencies for your testing framework:

For Selenium in Python:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install selenium
Choose a specific test case file from the test_cases/ directory.

Run the automation script for that test case using your preferred language or framework.

For example, running a test case in Python using Selenium:

bash
Copy
Edit
python test_scripts/test_case_name.py
⚠️ Make sure you have the appropriate web driver (e.g., ChromeDriver, GeckoDriver) installed and set up for the browser you wish to use.

📄 Example Test Case
Each test case follows this general structure:

Test Steps: Clear, sequential actions to perform in the software.

Expected Result: The expected output or behavior from the application.

Actual Result: The actual output generated during test execution.

Pass/Fail: The result of the test case.

For example, a simple login test case might look like this:

Test Case: Login Functionality

Test Steps:

Navigate to the login page.

Enter valid username and password.

Click the "Login" button.

Expected Result:
User should be successfully logged in and redirected to the dashboard.

Actual Result:
(Results will be logged by the automated script)

Pass/Fail:
(Test results logged in the report)
